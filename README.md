For one of my courses at UP (Theory of Computation), I was assigned to create an art project that illustrates my knowledge of the course's material. 
For my project, I implemented knowledge from my game design course and built a 2D game using the Unreal Engine. 
The game consists of different languages falling from the top of the screen. These languages are all regular, context-free, decidable, and/or undecidable. 
Depending on the current game mode, which changes every 30 seconds, the player must destroy every language within the provided category, before it hits the bottom. 
The goal of the game is to destroy as many of the correct language as possible. If a correct language hits the bottom, the player loses health. 
If a language outside of the provided category is clicked, health is also subtracted. 
For example, if the game mode says to destroy decidable languages, the player must destroy all languages that fall under, CFL, regular, and decidable 
(since the are all within the circle). However, if an undecidable language is destroyed, the player loses health.
Controls:
- Click on (with left mouse button) to destroy a given language
- Press Tab or Escape to pause game
- Allows you to see a diagram illustrating which languages to destroy
